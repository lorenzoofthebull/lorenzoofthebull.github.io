                1. Prototype Development: Create a small-scale prototype to validate the design concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Scalability: Scale the prototype to incorporate a "Growing Beyond Earth" LED panel.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Zero Gravity Simulation: Ensure the system can simulate zero gravity by rotating plants on multiple axes.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Light Integration: Integrate LED panel to provide adjustable light that moves with the plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Watering system: Develop a system for watering the plants while they are in motion. (Key focus)
            </p>
            <p>
                6. Random motion: Ensure that the movement of the clinostat is random to create a better low-gravity simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
                7. Plant encasement and diversity: Create or utilize a casing that will sit in the middle of the clinostat without moving and allow for a wide variety of vegetation to be able to grow in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. Lightweight and Durable: Construct the clinostat out of lightweight and durable material to ensure that there is limited stress across the entire device.
            </p>
            <p>
                9. Testing and Validation: Perform a series of tests to assess the performance of the scaled-up clinostat, and record/analyze the growth of plants under various conditions and compare with control samples.
            </p>
            <p>
                10. Cost efficient: Establish a design for the clinostat that is cost-effective, ensuring that several clinostats can be constructed at as cheap a price as possible if more are needed.
