                    Hi, I'm [Your Name], and I'm passionate about technology, engineering, and problem-solving.
                    I enjoy working on projects that allow me to explore electronics, design, and programming.
                    In my free time, I love hiking, playing video games (especially The Legend of Zelda), and tinkering
                    with broken devices to bring them back to life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing a career in engineering, where I can use my hands-on skills to create impactful solutions for real-world challenges. 
                    I thrive on learning new skills and taking on difficult tasks. My goal is to contribute to meaningful projects that push the boundaries of innovation.
                </p>
