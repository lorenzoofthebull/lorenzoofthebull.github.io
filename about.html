                    Hi, I’m Lorenzo De Toro. I’m an aspiring engineer here at Belen Jesuit Preparatory School. I’ve taken engineering classes since 10th grade, beginning with 
                    Introduction to Engineering Design all the way up to Honors Design and Innovation now in my senior year. I am passionate about engineering, technology, and 
                    problem-solving, and I enjoy working on projects that allow me to explore electronics, design, and programming. In my free time I love reading, riding bike, 
                    tinkering with circuit boards or broken devices, talking with friends, and playing video games (especially The Legend of Zelda).  
                </p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a career in engineering, where I can apply my problem-solving, hands-on, and design skills to create practical and impactful solutions 
                    to real-world issues. I thrive on learning new skills and taking on difficult challenges that will help me grow within this field and in my life. I hope to 
                    contribute to meaningful projects that will push the boundaries of innovation, starting within my Design and Innovation class.
                </p>
