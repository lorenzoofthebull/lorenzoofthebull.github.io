        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            Our first mini project involves learning and practicing 2D and 3D computer aided design, 
            CAD for short. I wanted to focus my designs on my main project: the building of a clinostat 
            for Fairchild’s Growing Beyond Earth science program. For the 2D design I wanted to create a 
            logo for my project, and the 3D design was to be some part that could be incorporated into 
            the final design of the clinostat. The main focus here was simply to get some practice with 
            computer aided design. Here’s how it went-

           <h2> 2D Computer Aided Design </h2>
           <p>
            My first order of business was to come up with a base design that I could begin working with. 
            I first wanted to get some inspiration for the project, so I went over to the GBE website to 
            see what they had. Here there was a header with their title and an image logo, which had purple 
            lettering and a growing leaf of lettuce in front of the ISS and the Earth. I decided that I 
            wanted to follow a similar color scheme with the greens and blues of the Earth and the purple 
            used in the lettering. In hindsight, sketching out possible designs for my logo may have been 
            a good idea for this step, however I ended up skipping this and just going straight into the 2D 
            CAD software, thinking that I would figure it out along the way. 
           </p>

           <br>

           <p>
            Next I needed to decide on what 2D software I was going to use. I wanted to create a 
            pixel-art-style logo, as I was going for a pixelated theme on my website and wanted to keep 
            everything the same, plus I’ve always been fond of this art style. I initially tried to use 
            Affinity’s vector graphics editor, Designer 2, using a Canva educational license, however this 
            presented an issue. While I was able to change the grid size down to the scale I wanted to work with, 
            I was unable to find a pixel brush that would work with the style I wanted. While looking online for 
            where the brush could be, I found that Affinity’s image editing software, Photo 2, had an easily 
            accessible pixel brush, so I switched over to this application to start my design.

            <p>
                To begin my project, I had to select the size of my canvas. I wanted to go with a square shape, 
                so I selected the “Social Media Square Post” option. After that, I lowered the pixel size to 64 
                px by 64 px. While this did mean I would have to learn how to change the sizing later to export 
                the image, this sizing allowed me to work on the design with the pixel size that I wanted.

            <br>

            <p>I had already been brainstorming what my design was going to be: an image of the Earth floating in 
                space with a plant sprout growing up and out at the top. I first began by drawing out a circle, 
                creating a 34 px by 34 px cross and following a 3-3-2-1-2 pattern to create the roundness of the circle.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D4.PNG" Alt="2D4" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                Next I filled in the circle with a teal color known as Skobeloff. I also draw in different continents 
                while centering on the Atlantic Ocean, namely sections of North America, South America, Europe, and 
                Africa, using a forest green color. Lastly, I repositioned the Earth to be centered horizontally, but 
                be placed on the lower half of the canvas vertically.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D6.PNG" Alt="2D6" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                Next I drew in the outline of the growing sprout in a darker shade of green (japanese laurel), 
                making sure to give the plant an organic feel using light curves and an asymmetrical design.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D7.PNG" Alt="2D7" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                Here I colored in the plant using a different, now lighter shade of green (may green) and finally 
                added a background, using dark purple to depict space and follow along with the color palette that 
                I had chosen before beginning.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D8.PNG" Alt="2D8" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                I thought the dark purple background was too plain, so I decided to create a small gradient, going 
                from a dark purple at the top to a light regalia purple at the bottom.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D11.PNG" Alt="2D11" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                Now all that was left was to add details. I began with adding white stars in the background, using 
                mostly single-pixels but also drawing a few small crosses for bigger stars. I also added two levels 
                of shading to the continents, going from darker on the outside to lighter in the center, to add some 
                more color and vibrancy to the Earth.
            </p>
            <img src="images/2D CAD/2D15.PNG" Alt="2D15" class="center">
            <br>

            <p>
                Lastly, I added some different shades of blue to the water, using a lighter shade of blue around the 
                coasts while using a darker shade in the ocean areas further from land. I also added a small satellite 
                orbiting the Earth as a tiny extra detail.

            <p>
                Exporting the image was a small challenge as I had to figure out how to scale the image up without 
                having the resolution drop. After changing one setting I was able to do this no issue and send it 
                over to Google Drive. Here is the final product:

            <p>
                For my 3D design, I wanted to model some sort of casing for where the plant would grow. There are several 
                different options for what medium the plant would grow in, however I decided that rapid rooter plug would 
                be an easy option to model for. These were used in a zero gravity grow box, which was one of the resources 
                our RFP provided us. The rapid rooter plugs provide a good place for the plants to grow as they provide 
                several necessary nutrients and don’t fall apart like regular planting soil, instead staying put together. 
                Here I try to make an all-encapsulating case for the plug so that it can sit in the clinostat. The image 
                on the right provided me with the necessary measurements for the model, where I used the measurements when 
                soaked.  This is not the definitive solution for how the plant will sit in the clinostat, nor is it a 
                complete design, but rather a possible solution and a way to practice my 3D modeling skills.

                I chose to work with Fusion 360, as I am familiar with and have experience using the program.

            <p>
                I started off by creating a new component for the main holder, titled ‘Holder”. In this component I created a 
                sketch of a 1.5 in square with the fillet tool applied to the corners with a 0.25 in radius. Finally, I extruded 
                the sketch up 1.6 in to create the base shape of the holder. 
                After creating the main body, I created a new sketch on the top face of the shape, this time creating a 1.2 in square, 
                again with the fillet tool applied to the corners with a 0.25 in radius. This sketch was then extruded down into the 
                shape with a -3° angle, creating a hole tapering inward. This creates the slot where the rapid rooter plug can sit 
                inside, even at the max size while wet.

            <p>
                Next, I created a new component, titled “Lid”, so I can make the lid that will close the case. I began by creating a 
                plane at the top of the holder to work on, then making a sketch and projecting the outside lines of the holder beneath, 
                that way the lid measurements are exactly the same as the holder. I extruded this sketch up 0.75 in to create the lid. 
                Then I created two small holes with a 0.075 in diameter on either side of the lid, centered to the middle of the lid 
                vertically. I then extruded these circles down 0.25 in, creating two slots for potential screws or pegs to hold the 
                lid and holder together. Finally, I sketched a 0.5 in diameter circle in the center of the lid and extruded it down, 
                creating a slot for the plant to grow through.

                The final image shows the final design with the different parts dimensionalized. One aspect I can add on to this design 
                later if we choose to continue working with it are clips or slot on each side so it can actually be held by the clinostat.
