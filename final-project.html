            <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
            <p> One of humanity's greatest challenges in preparing for extended missions beyond Earth is figuring out 
                how to cultivate food in space. Understanding which plants thrive in low-gravity or zero-gravity environments 
                and how they do so is a critical need for future space operations. As such, it has become necessary to create 
                an environment here on Earth where it is possible to simulate a low-gravity or zero-gravity environment while 
                still controlling the amount of water and light that the plant recieves.
            </p>

            <h2>EXPLANATION</h2>
            <p><a href="https://fairchildgarden.org/science-and-education/science/gbe/">Fairchild's Growing Beyond Earth</a> 
                science program seeks to address this issue through the creation of a three-dimensional clinostat. This device 
                will rotate in random motion along three axes, which will enable controlled experiments that mimic the 
                low/zero-gravity environment that space provides. This will allow researchers to study which plants are 
                suitable for such an environment and how certain plants adapt to growing in such an environment. The data 
                gathered from this project will directly support NASAâ€™s Artemis project, which aims at leading humanity forward 
                in establishing permanent bases on the moon to facilitate human missions to Mars and aid in researching the 
                rest of space.
