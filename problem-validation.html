            <p>
                To validate this project, it became necessary to first conduct research on different aspects 
                of this project. I focused my research primarily on clinostats, finding academic papers through 
                scholar.google.com. After finding my sources, I read trough them, summarized them, and added my 
                own critique or notes to it. Here are the results of that research:

            <p> Paper 1: </p>
            <p> The Physical Basis of Gravity Stimulus Nullification by Clinostat Rotation </p>
            <p>
                This document explores how clinostat devices eliminate/reduce the effects of gravity on plant cells. 
                These clinostat devices rotate plants around a horizontal axis. This rotation results in the particles 
                within the plant cells following a quasi-circular path, which effectively nullifies gravity’s impact 
                by keeping these particles near-stationary. This study also presents a method to calculate the optimal 
                rotation rate that minimizes the effects of both gravity and centrifugal forces. This enables researchers 
                to simulate microgravity environments and study plant growth within such an environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The authors also discuss the limitations of single-axis clinostats, especially for large plants and 
                long-duration experiments, and propose multi-axis designs to overcome these challenges. They argue that most low-gravity 
                biological responses can be studied using clinostats, reducing the need for expensive satellite-based 
                experiments. This research is significant for space biology, providing a theoretical and practical 
                foundation for simulating zero-gravity conditions in biological studies.

            <p> Development and Validation of a 3D Clinostat for the Study of Cells during Microgravity Simulation </p>
            <p>
                This article discusses the creation and validation of a 3D clinostat, a device used to simulate microgravity 
                conditions on Earth by rotating cells or biological samples along multiple axes. This device was designed 
                by the Microgravity Laboratory/IPCT-PUCRS and tested by Kingston University's Stem Cell Therapy Group. Its 
                primary purpose is to study how different types of human cells, such as cancer cells and stem cells, react 
                to microgravity. These studies aim to understand how cells adapt to reduced gravity, which is crucial for 
                space exploration and understanding health risks in astronauts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The clinostat's validation was conducted by testing four types of human cancer cells and cord blood stem 
                cells (CBSC). The results showed both significantly enhanced proliferation of the cells compared to static 
                conditions and that the clinostat effectively simulates the effects of microgravity, making it a valuable 
                tool for both biological research and space medicine.

            <h2>
                Patent Research
            </h2>
            <p>
                After reading through academic papers, I shifted my focus over to researching patents that showed previous attempts
                at solutions for issues relating to this project. Two of the patents relate to clinostats, however the last relates 
                moreso to the process of supplyng liquid and nutrients to plants in space. Here are the results of that research:
            </p>

            <p> Patent 1: </p>
            <p> 3-Dimensional Clinostat for Cell Culture (US7291500B2) </p>
            <p>
                This patent presents a 3-dimensional clinostat designed to simulate microgravity for the cultivation of tissues 
                and cells. The primary goals are to enable the formation of 3-dimensional tissues, prevent cell dispersion, support 
                long-term cultivation, and optimize the growth environment. The clinostat achieves this by rotating cell cultures 
                around multiple axes, which reduces the effects of gravity. The method involves encapsulating cells or cell lumps 
                with fluid and possibly an artificial matrix in a vessel, adjusting the viscosity of the fluid to keep cells from 
                touching the vessel walls, and promoting cell differentiation. This setup allows for the creation of large, complex 
                tissues and artificial organs, with the capability to adjust fluid circulation and matrix support as needed for 
                optimal growth conditions.

            <p> Patent 2: </p>
            <p> Fast rotating clinostat useful for weightlessness simulation, comprises receptacle for receiving organisms or substances, 
                radiation generator for generating optical radiation, and radiation receiver device for detecting optical radiation (DE102011080696A1)
            </p>
            <p>
                The patent describes a fast-rotating clinostat designed to simulate weightlessness and facilitate the study of small 
                organisms or substances under these conditions. The clinostat operates by rotating a receptacle around an axis, preventing 
                sedimentation of particles and mimicking a zero-gravity environment. It features a radiation generator, such as high-power 
                diodes, and a radiation receiver, like photomultipliers or fluorescence microscopes, to study luminescence in organisms 
                mixed with luminescent dyes. The system allows for flexible experimentation with various wavelengths of optical radiation 
                and is housed in a light-tight chamber to avoid interference from ambient light. The clinostat can be configured to perform 
                both quantitative analysis, using photomultipliers, and qualitative analysis, using fluorescence microscopes. Design variations 
                include a capillary receptacle with photomultipliers in one embodiment and a slide with a fluorescence microscope in another, 
                each tailored to capture and analyze luminescence effectively. This invention aims to improve the study of small organisms 
                and substances by integrating advanced detection methods and rotation mechanisms.

            <p> Patent 3: </p>
            <p> Intelligent aeroponic microgravity & earth nutrient delivery (i-amend) system for bioregenerative space life support and earth applications (US20240049664A1) </p>
            <p>
                The patent details the I-AMEND System, a specialized aeroponic nutrient delivery system designed to support crop growth in both 
                microgravity and terrestrial environments. The system features an aeroponic chamber equipped with a Liquid Nutrient Emitter and 
                an Air Emitter. In operation, the Liquid Nutrient Emitter releases pressurized liquid nutrients toward the crop roots, while the 
                Air Emitter helps move these nutrients through the root mass by pushing floating droplets or bulk liquid. This innovative approach 
                ensures efficient nutrient delivery and promotes optimal crop growth. Unlike previous systems, which often direct liquid and air 
                in multiple directions or use emitters primarily for liquid dispersion, the I-AMEND System uses emitters configured to direct liquid 
                and air in a single direction along the chamber. This design enhances the forward movement of nutrients and gases, particularly in 
                microgravity. The system's advantages include effective nutrient delivery, efficient resource use, and versatility for applications 
                in space habitats, lunar or Martian environments, and on Earth. The patent includes various embodiments and illustrations to depict 
                different configurations and functionalities of the system.

                Finally, I tried reaching out to professionals for help or mentorship for this project. I first emailed 
                Dr. Carl E Lewis, the director of Fairchild and one of the organizers of the Fairchild Growing Beyond 
                Earth project. I reached out, letting him know that my team and I were the students at Belen Jesuit that 
                were undertaking this project. I also asked him for guidance and let him know that any mentorship was 
                welcome and appreciated.

                I also emailed Dr. Javier Francisco-Ortega, a professor a professor at FIU in the Department of Biological 
                Sciences. I saw his profile on Fairchild's research department page and noticed his extensive research on
                different species of tropical plants. I reached out to askif he would be able to help us in any way with 
                finding different plant species that would thrive in a microgravity environment. Unfortunately, he responded 
                by letting us know that this topic was outside of his expertise.
