                To validate this project, it became necessary to first conduct research on different aspects 
                of this project. I focused my research primarily on clinostats, finding academic papers through 
                scholar.google.com. After finding my sources, I read trough them, summarized them, and added my 
                own critique or notes to it. Here are the results of that research:

            <p>The Physical Basis of Gravity Stimulus Nullification by Clinostat Rotation</p>
            <p>
                This document explores how clinostat devices eliminate/reduce the effects of gravity on plant cells. 
                These clinostat devices rotate plants around a horizontal axis. This rotation results in the particles 
                within the plant cells following a quasi-circular path, which effectively nullifies gravity’s impact 
                by keeping these particles near-stationary. This study also presents a method to calculate the optimal 
                rotation rate that minimizes the effects of both gravity and centrifugal forces. This enables researchers 
                to simulate microgravity environments and study plant growth within such an environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The authors also discuss the limitations of single-axis clinostats, especially for large plants and 
                long-duration experiments, and propose multi-axis designs to overcome these challenges. They argue that most low-gravity 
                biological responses can be studied using clinostats, reducing the need for expensive satellite-based 
                experiments. This research is significant for space biology, providing a theoretical and practical 
                foundation for simulating zero-gravity conditions in biological studies.

                Finally,I tried reaching out to professionals for help or mentorship for this project. I first emailed 
                Dr. Carl E Lewis, the director of Fairchild and one of the organizers of the Fairchild Growing Beyond 
                Earth project. I reached out, letting him know that my team and I were the students at Belen Jesuit that 
                were undertaking this project. I also asked him for guidance and let him know that any mentorship was 
                welcome and appreciated.

                I also emailed Dr. Javier Francisco-Ortega, a professor a professor at FIU in the Department of Biological 
                Sciences. I saw his profile on Fairchild's research department page and noticed his extensive research on
                different species of tropical plants. I reached out to askif he would be able to help us in any way with 
                finding different plant species that would thrive in a microgravity environment. Unfortunately, he responded 
                by letting us know that this topic was outside of his expertise.
