                While this page is being worked on, I am going to be recording how the prototyping process has gone thus far.

                We began by working on the lighting lystem. We procured two WS2812B LED Panels to use as lights for our small 
                prototype, mimicking the light panels that we will have to use for the actual clinostat. I first went to ChatGPT 
                to research how to program the board. This is where I learned about the Adafruit Neopixel library. After 
                installing this and using the base code that ChatGPT suggested, my teammate Jack and I were able to turn the 
                light on. However, of the 256 total LEDs in the 16x16 pixel display, only 64 turned on, and any attempt to 
                change the color of the lights failed. After trouble shooting with the code, the LED panels, and the arduino 
                board, we figured out that because the board was drawing too much power from the laptop that it was connected 
                to to turn the LEDs on, the computer didn't recognize the port correctly and couldn't upload the code to the 
                board. The lapptop also wasn't supplying enough power to turn on all the lights, as shown below.

                After switching to a more powerful laptop and disconnecting the lights when uploading the code to the board, 
                we were able to successfully turn on the LED panel, and even have it change colors. However, I believe it 
                necessary to look into adding a relay to the circuit to take away the stress of the current from the arduino 
                board and not risk it overheating or frying. After getting one panel to work, all that was necessary to add 
                the other panel was to daisy chain it to the first panel and double to pixel count in the initial code. The 
                next images show the single and double panel circuits.
