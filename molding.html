            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For this mini project, we were tasked with making silicone-based molds and creating a resin cast with it. Two methods of 
                mold-making were taught to the class: Open-face molds and Two-part molds. I had already had an interest in mold-making, 
                so I got really excited with this project, making several different molds, with a focus on dice molds. Here’s how it went.

            <h2>
                Dice Molding
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’ve always had an interest in fantasy, in storytelling, and one of the greatest forms of this comes in the form of the 
                role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons. The game can be played as strictly or as loosely as you and your friends decide, 
                however one of the few key elements throughout any version of the game is the use of dice to decide what happens with 
                the characters and the world. This emphasis on dice within the game led me to look into making them a while ago, looking 
                at different videos with different techniques. Until this class, however, I never had the right equipment and materials, 
                so being given the chance to make dice molds, I jumped right in.
            </p>
            <p>
                I knew I wanted to make the whole set of dice, so while I waited for a set of sharp-edge dice I ordered to come in, I 
                started to make a practice mold with some small D6s I had. I wanted to go with sprue-type molds, which are essentially 
                open-back molds that have a channel, or sprue, that feeds the resin into the actual dice. I attached the sprue to the 
                edge of the 1 side of the D6 using super glue and attached the other side to a spare D6 to act as a slot for the resin 
                to sit in and fall into the mold. After that I hot-glued the spare D6 to the bottom of a cup, so that the main D6 for 
                the mold was in the middle of the cup. After this, I put on some gloves and mixed together equal parts of part A and B 
                of a silicone rubber to create this silicone that will form the mold of the die. I slowly poured the mixture into the 
                cup, making sure to have as little bubbles as possible as well as covering every surface of the die. Once covered, I 
                let it sit for 6 hours to solidify. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I returned the next day with the mold completed. I used an exacto-knife to cut along the edge of the sprue and die to 
                create a slit for the cast to come out of the mold. Once I removed the original dice, I quickly mixed equal parts of 
                an epoxy resin and a hardener to pour into the mold. This resin was clear, which I personally prefer to opaque resins, 
                however one issue presented itself after the mold was completed. Before that, however, I struggled with pouring the 
                resin into the mold. I’m unsure if I was just being impatient or if the resin just struggled going down the thing sprue, 
                but while pouring, the resin would remain in the top recess. Because I just wanted to see how the cast came out, I 
                opened the mold up and poured the resin for the die straight in. This resulted in excess resin pouring out of the side 
                of the mold, however the majority of the resin remained inside the mold. By the following day, the mold was ready. The 
                die came out pretty decent, with only one large bubble leaving a whole in one corner. It also came out very cloudy as 
                a result of a build up of small bubbles within the die.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remade this die a few more times. I repeated the same exact process with clear resin, only changing how I stirred the 
                resin, opting for a slower stir, which left less bubbles in the resin and therefore creating a clearer die after casting 
                it. The next two attempts were dyed, however the main difference was that I used a vacuum chamber to take the bubbles 
                out of the resin before pouring it, giving me extremely clear dice afterwards. Finally, I tried again using a method I 
                saw online of using pipette to put the resin into the sprue molds. This technique somewhat worked, but it gave me two 
                large bubbles at the top of the die, which may just have happened because of my lack of experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, with my new sharp-edge dice in hand, I proceeded with making a two-part mold, or squish mold, for the 
                whole set. After doing some research on how to do this (mainly with the youtube channel Rybonator), I went and got the 
                necessary materials: transfer tape, a 3D printed shell, and a 3D printed key. The shell was made to act as a solid 
                container to pour the silicone into, and the key was made to create a recess within the first half of the mold to 
                create a slot for the cap to lock into place. The shell also had arrowheads on one half so as to create sections for 
                the mold to interlock. I cut out a piece of the transfer tape and laid it out before placing the two shell halves 
                together and using clamps to hold them tightly together. Next, I hot glued the bottom edge of the shell to the 
                transfer tape to prevent any silicone from leaking out. I then placed the key inside the shell, firmly securing it 
                to the tape. This specific key divided the circular area inside the shell into 6 sections - one for each die. Before 
                I placed the dice inside, I cleaned them using a small alcohol wipey. Then, carefully, I placed each die into its 
                own section. After this, I mixed together the silicone, slowly poured it into the shell, making sure it went into 
                every crevice and fully covered every die, and let it sit for roughly 6 hours. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I returned towards the end of the day once the silicone had cured. Next, I flipped the shell over around the mold to 
                make the cap of the mold. I did the same preparations as before, with the added step of spraying a release agent on 
                the mold. Once done, I again mixed and poured in the silicone and let it sit overnight to cure. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I returned the following day to have a completed mold. However, because of an issue with correctly spraying the 
                release agent, I had a difficult time pulling the two halves of the mold apart. This caused a few imperfections 
                that affected the casts I made later. Now that I had a completed cap mold, I mixed together some resin, dyed it 
                purple with a few drops of food coloring, and poured it in to cure overnight. By the next day, I had my first 
                complete set of casted dice. However, these dice came out with several large bubbles where the cap of the mold was, 
                as well as a larger surface again on the cap side. This was a consequence of two factors, one that I caused and one 
                relating to how the mold was made. The first was that I pressed down on the cap molds too much. When I pushed down, 
                the resin was pushed into the mold, but when the cap came back up after I pushed, a vacuum bubble was left behind, 
                ruining the cast. The second fault was how the cap was designed, being too thin and not having easy-fit registrations. 
                This meant that it wasn’t heavy enough to clamp itself down, and that the keys actually made it more difficult to 
                lock the mold in place, resulting in the previously said issues. Even on my second and thirds attempts, where I used 
                vacuumed resin and slowly shimmied the cap on instead of pushing it down, the dice still had large (yet slightly 
                smaller than before) bubbles on the “1” side attached to the cap because of the flimsiness of the cap.
            </p>
            <p>
                To resolve this issue, I decided to make a second version of the dice mold, a “Mark II” if you will. I used a different 
                silicone for this mold, which ended up being better as it came out slightly more dense. I repeated the same setup for 
                the first half, however this time I used modified 3D printed pieces: the shell now had spikes instead of arrowheads 
                to allow the cap to more easily slide onto the base, and the key was now slightly wider than before. Apart from that, 
                taping down the dice and pouring in the resin was the same. I made sure to make the base slightly shorter this time, 
                the reason for which I’ll come back to in a moment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the base was done, I removed the shell and tape to get ready to flip the mold over to pour the cap. However, this 
                time I took an exacto-knife to the mold and cut out larger recesses along the ones made by the key and spikes. I made 
                the spikes much larger and I widened and angled the key lines inside the mold. This was done in order to create better 
                registrations for the cap to fall into. Once done, I tried another new method: using vaseline as a release agent. I had 
                heard that this worked much better than most sprays, so I gave it a try. Once I coated the whole top of the mold with 
                vaseline, I reattached the shell, clamping it down with new, much stronger clamps, and poured in the silicone for the 
                cap. The reason I had made the base shorter earlier was so that I would have more room inside the closed shell to pour 
                silicone for the cap. This was in order to make the cap much taller and therefore heavier, Helping it weigh itself 
                down on top of the resin. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The mold was done the next day, and I couldn’t be happier with how it came out. The cap cleanly came off of the base, 
                leaving behind nill imperfections around the dice imprints. And the wider, angled recesses along with the weight of 
                the cap meant that it easily slid into place. I wanted to make something special for the first set of dice I made 
                with this mold. I mixed around 5 oz of total resin (which in hindsight was too much) and set aside about 1.5 oz. For 
                the main color, I mixed a sparkly mica powder with a blue shine into the resin. As for the smaller portion, I dyed it 
                blue with the food coloring, and set two pipette to suck up the resin. I first vacuumed out most of the bubbles from 
                both resins. Then I poured the mica powder resin into the molds, filling them up all the way. Next, I took one of the 
                pipettes and stuck it into one of the die molds. I slowly dispensed the blue resin into the molds in a swirl-like 
                fashion. When one pipette ran out of resin, I used the other, slowly dispensing the resin so as not to create any 
                bubbles. Once I finished, I put the cap on, which slid down nicely. I weighed it down anyway to be sure the casts 
                came out good and let it sit until the next day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, when I checked the dice in the morning, I was extremely happy with the result. With the exception of tiny 
                bubbles across the surface (which could only really be removed with a pressure pot) and a slightly larger bubble 
                on the D20, these dice came out perfect. The effect of the swirling blue inside sparkle came out perfectly, and 
                the “1” face across the dice wasn’t too elevated. To finish them up, I sanded down and polished the “1” face and 
                grabbed some enamel paint (which I don’t recommend now, as the oil-base makes it harder to work with for projects 
                like this) to ink the numbers, completing the set.

            <h2>Other Molds</h2>
            <p>
                On top of the dice, I also made two other molds: a two-part mold of a low-poly Virgin Mary and an open back mold 
                of a low-poly fox. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The two-part mold of Mary was probably the second-most difficult mold I made. The first step was to make a box that 
                could encapsulate the whole object with some spare room. After making this with styrofoam and hot glue, I placed 
                Mary into a large chunk of clay and put that into the box, filling in any empty corners with clay as well. After 
                poking 6 holes to act as keys into the clay, I poured in the silicone and painted for it to cure. Once ready, I tore 
                the box apart and carefully took the clay off without taking Mary out of the mold. I made a new box and fit it around 
                the first half of the mold with Mary still inside. I then sprayed a hefty amount of the release spray (this was before 
                I learned of the vaseline method) onto the mold and poured in new silicone for the second half. This half cured, and 
                after struggling to take the two halves apart (and losing one cylinder key), I had a completed mold of my low-poly 
                Virgin Mary. Because I had forgotten to create one earlier in the mold, I had to cut out a recess that I could use to 
                pour the resin in. My first attempt was just with clear resin, which came out with a few bubbles and slightly thinner 
                than the original (maybe because I had placed rubber bands around the mold to secure it).My second attempt with this 
                mold, using blue resin that I had placed into the vacuum chamber, came out with much less bubbles, but was missing a 
                lot of resin at the feet where the recess was, because I poured in slightly less than what I needed as a result of 
                having difficulty seeing if I had poured in enough or not. Both attempts suffered from heavy flashing, or excess 
                resin along the middle of the mold, however this came off easily with an exacto-knife. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My final mold, that of a low-poly fox, was extremely simple. I used a small piece of the transfer tape and attached 
                the fox to it before hanging it upside down in half of a small paper cup. I then poured in the silicone into the cup 
                and pushed the tape down slightly, making sure the fox was fully inside the silicone. Once this was cured, the mold 
                was down. I mixed together a small amount of resin and dyed it red to pour in. This attempt came out great except for 
                bubble that got trapped where the ears and nose would have been, as the spots are hard for the resin to get into, 
                instead trapping air when the resin goes into the mold. Overall, I had a blast with this mini project, and I hope to 
                keep using this skill into my future. One self note, make sure that you always use protective gear when working with 
                resin. Too much contact with resin can make you hypersensitive to it, which would mean that you could no longer work 
                with resin.
