            This project has been such an amazing opportunity and journey. I've gotten to learn so much of the engineering process, 
            from team management to resource research to struggling for days until something clicks. My focus on the electronics 
            of the project has helped me learn more about electrical engineering as a whole, which I expect to pursue going into 
            college. This being legacy project of course means that our efforts will be taken and improved upon by the next team 
            that undertakes this task. This project still needs a lot of work and a lot of love, but the progress we've made will 
            definitely give the next team an easier time heading into it. As far as our team's efficiency went, I'd say there was 
            a good amount of room for improvement. Better organization and clearly defined roles and deadlines would have resulted 
            in much more progress being made. There were also days where not much work was being done because too much focus was 
            placed in one part of the project, or we were waiting for parts to come in. Finding a way to better utilize this wasted 
            time elsewhere would have greatly improved our efficency. That being said, the team worked together really well, with 
            good communication about what the projected needed next.
